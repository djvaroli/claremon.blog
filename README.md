# Claremon Blog (a.k.a Daniel's (and friends) blog)

https://claremon.blog

### What goes into this blog?
While the blog is for now not as populated as I would like it to be, as time goes on you should look to find posts on topics ranging from machine learning and mathemtaics to
cooking and sports science. All things that I find very interesting in general. 

Currently this blog is hosted with GCP and run in GCR.

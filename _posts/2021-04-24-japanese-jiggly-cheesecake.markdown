I messed this one up the first time I tried to make it by adding the sugar after I had beaten the egg whites. I later learned that the sugar acts as mini shovels that dig into the egg white creating air pocket that then expand which is part of what makes the cheesecake tall, fluffy and jiggly (maybe?). In any case, here are the ingredients and the steps, though make sure to watch the original video as well.

## Ingredients 
* 160g Cream cheese
* 20g unslated butter (softened)
* Hot water
* 50 ml (3.5 tbsp) milk
* 40 grams cake flour
* 4 egg yolks
* 4 egg whites
* 1/4 tsp lemon juice
* 80g sugar
* Honey

## Instructions
* Begin by putting a medium-sized sauce pan filled with water on high heat
* Put creame cheese in a glass bowl and mix until smooth (velvety smooth)
* Add softened (room temp) butter to the cream cheese
* Once water reaches a boil, remove sauce pan from heat
* Place glass bowl over the sauce pan and begin mixing. Keep mixing until nice and smooth and combined
* Add milk and keep mixing until combined
* Add cake flour to the mixture, preferrable by running it through a sieve.
* Mix until combined and velvety smooth (again)
* Add the egg yolks and... you guessed it, mix again. Until combined
* Place the egg whites in a bowl, add the lemon juice and beat until semi-foamy and semi-liquidy (If that's not vague)
* Add sugar in 3 batches, beating the eggwhites after each time.
* At the end you want the eggwhites to form solid peaks when you remove the beaters.
* Add a third of the egg-whites to your flour mixture and mix again, until combined
* Repeat that with the remaining two thirds of the egg whites. (For the last round you can just pour the yellow mixture into the egg whites)
* Find a tall cake pan or some other container that you think works and place that into a large baking tray. You want the baking tray to have high sides since you are going to add water to the baking tray.
* Make a circular cutout of parchment paper to fit the pan.
* Pour cake mixture into the mold and then pour hot water into the baking tray.
* Preheat oven to 190 Celcius (380 F) - note, these temperatures worked for me, but the original recipe calls for other temperatures.
* Once ondo is at temp, bake for about 20 minutes. Crucial step here is to make sure the cake actually rises, and has some color on the top. I had to experiment a bit to get the right temperatures.
* Once the cake has risen and the top has some color to it, open the oven, count to 5 then close the oven and lower temp to about 110 Celcius (230 F) and cook for another hour.
* Once time has elapsed, remove mold/pan from the oven give it a tap on all sides and slide the cake out onto a plate
* Remove the parchment paper on the bottom
* As a finishing touch brush the top of the cake with some honey

Good job, you made a Japanese jiggly cheesecake. Just watch it jiggle.

Hey everyone! 
This is our very first blog post! Really, I am using this to test out the minimal mistakes theme that I am using for the blog,
but why not use this to introduce the people who will be behind the blog. 

My name is Daniel. I am a data scientist at Proton AI, a Boton-based startup in the distribution industry! Check out our website, it's really nice. I like to think that I am good at mathematics but I definitely not as good as I think I am, though perhaps writing some posts about topics I find interesting will help me get better. I also really like playing the electric guitar (Metallica all the way!). I also enjoy soccer and rock climbing among other things.

The other person who will be helping me run this blog is Hissan. He will eventually write this part himself.
